The data from Merge sort should represent an n log n graph. With seven types of data set (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000), this allowed our graph to have line of best fit using these points. Each array was ran 10000 through a for loop. We then took the average of the 10000 times to get an average runtime for each data set size. Check out results here:
