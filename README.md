While the data from Merge sort should represent an n log n graph, it is rather difficult to see an exact graph due to our lack of points. With four types of data set (1,10,100 and 1000), this only allows our graph to have 4 points. In addition, based on on the data given by Yuyang and Datian on the Google document down below, both lines have similiar data until the "huge" set, where Datian's computer seemed to take a little more time. Each array was ran 10000 through a for loop. We then took the average of the 10000 times.
